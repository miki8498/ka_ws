'''
ACT: Activation bit
0 - Gripper not activated
1 - Gripper activated
GTO: 1 if the gripper is set to move to requested position 0 if gripper is set to stay at the same place
PRE: Position request eco. Should be same a the requested position if
the gripper successfully received the requested position.
POS: Current position of the gripper
SPE: Speed eco. Should be same as requested speed.
FOR: Force parameter of the gripper
OBJ: Object grippings status
0 - Fingers are inmotion towards requested position.No object detected.
1 - Fingers have stopped due to a contact while opening before requested position.Object detected opening.
2 - Fingers have stopped due to a contact while closing before requested position.Object detected closing.
3 - Fingers are at requested position.No object detected or object has been loss / dropped.
STA: Gripper status, returns the current status & motion of theGripper fingers.
0 -Gripper is in reset ( or automatic release )state. See Fault Status if Gripper is activated.
1 - Activation in progress.
2 - Not used.
3 - Activation is completed.
MOD: ...
FLT: Fault status returns general errormessages that are useful for troubleshooting. Fault LED (red) is present on theGripper chassis,
LED can be blue, red or both and be solid or blinking.
0 - No fault (LED is blue)
Priority faults (LED is blue)
5 - Action delayed, activation (reactivation)must be completed prior to performing the action.
7 - The activation bit must be set prior to action.
Minor faults (LED continuous red)
8 -Maximum operating temperature exceeded,wait for cool-down.
9 No communication during at least 1 second.
Major faults (LED blinking red/blue) - Reset is required (rising edge on activation bit rACT needed).
10 - Underminimum operating voltage.
11- Automatic release in progress.
12- Internal fault; contact support@robotiq.com.
13 - Activation fault, verify that no interference or other error occurred.
14-Overcurrent triggered.
15- Automatic release completed.
